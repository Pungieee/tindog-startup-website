This is a simple startup-style landing page project for **practicing Bootstrap**.  

### What I practiced

- Using **Bootstrap grid system** (`container`, `row`, `col`) for responsive layouts  
- Styling elements with **Bootstrap classes** (`text-center`, `btn`, `card`, `p-3`, `mb-4`, etc.)  
- Adding **buttons and icons** with **SVG**  
- Using **utility classes** for spacing, typography, colors, and alignment  
- Building **sections** like hero/title, features, testimonials, pricing, and footer  
- Linking **external Bootstrap CSS** and custom CSS

Pretty much just experimenting with **layout, responsiveness, and Bootstrap components :)**
